                Trekoholic is a passion driven effort backed by wanderers who prefer treading down off-beat terrain and conquering less chartered territories. Traveling is our passion and over the years we have conquered a number of road-trips and treks and amassed data based on our experience and not just from the internet.
                <br>&nbsp;</br>
                Based on our experiences and the plethora of stories to tell this website has been envisioned as an effort towards bringing fellow travelers and trekkers from across the country to contribute their experiences and suggestions so that the data can be used as a guide for anyone who has been traveling or planning to set up an adventure.
                <br>&nbsp;</br>
                To summarise the website is an effort to provide information on the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Know-How's about trekking

                    This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the Trekoholic Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Trekoholic, as well as Trekoholic brands, products and services, which we call the “Trekoholic Services” or “Services”. By using or accessing the Trekoholic Services, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 13 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how Trekoholic works. Because Trekoholic provides a wide range of Services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with a specific app, product, or service. To the extent those supplemental terms conflict with this SRR, the supplemental terms associated with the app, product, or service govern with respect to your use of such app, product or service to the extent of the conflict.

                    <span class="title">Privacy</span>
                    Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Trekoholic to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.

                    <span class="title">Sharing Your Content and Information</span>
                    You own all of the content and information you post on Trekoholic, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:

                        <li>
                            For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Trekoholic (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.

                        <li>
                            When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

                            When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others have shared with you. We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information. (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with applications, read our Data Policy and Platform Page.)

                            When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Trekoholic, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).
